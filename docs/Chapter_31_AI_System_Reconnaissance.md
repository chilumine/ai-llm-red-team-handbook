# Chapter 31: AI System Reconnaissance

![ ](assets/page_header.svg)

_This chapter details the methodology for mapping the attack surface of AI/LLM deployments. We explore techniques for model fingerprinting, identifying backend infrastructure (Vector DBs, Orchestrators), and enumerating exposed APIs. It serves as the "Nmap" phase of AI Red Teaming._

## 31.1 Introduction

Before launching an attack, a red teamer must understand the target. AI systems are complex stacks of models, plugins, databases, and APIs. Reconnaissance identifies which specific components are in use, their versions, and their potential weaknesses.

### Why This Matters

- **Tailored Attacks:** Knowing the specific model family (e.g., Llama-2 vs. GPT-4) allows for highly optimized prompt injection attacks.
- **Shadow AI:** Organizations often have undocumented AI endpoints ("Shadow AI") that lack standard security controls.
- **Dependency Risks:** Identifying a vulnerable version of LangChain or Pinecone can offer a quick path to compromise.

### Key Concepts

- **Model Fingerprinting:** Inferring the model type based on its output quirks, tokenization patterns, or refusal messages.
- **Infrastructure Enumeration:** Identifying the supporting stack (Vector Stores, Orchestration frameworks).
- **Prompt Probing:** Using systematic inputs to elicit system instructions or configuration details.

### Theoretical Foundation

#### Why This Works (System Behavior)

Reconnaissance works because AI systems, like all software, emit signals.

- **Architectural Factor:** Different models have distinct "personalities" and tokenization vocabularies. A `500 Internal Server Error` might reveal a Python traceback from a specific library.
- **Training Artifact:** Models' refusal styles ("I cannot do that" vs. "As an AI language model") are strong signatures of their RLHF alignment training.
- **Input Processing:** The latency of the response can reveal model size (parameter count) or the presence of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) lookups.

#### What This Reveals About LLMs

It reveals that LLMs are leaky abstractions. The abstraction layer (the chat interface) rarely perfectly hides the underlying machinery (the model weights and code).

#### Chapter Scope

We will cover passive and active reconnaissance, model fingerprinting techniques, and infrastructure enumeration using custom tools.

## 31.2 Model Fingerprinting

Model fingerprinting is the art of determining the backend model (e.g., `gpt-4`, `claude-2`, `llama-2-70b`) based on its responses.

### How Fingerprinting Works

```text
[Fingerprinting Flow]
Red Teamer → [Probe Prompt] → Endpoint → [Response Style/Quirk] → Fingerprint DB → [Model ID]
```

### Mechanistic Explanation

1. **Refusal Style:** Anthropic models tend to define themselves as "helpful and harmless." OpenAI models use standard "As an AI language model developed by OpenAI" disclaimers.
2. **Tokenization Quirks:** Different tokenizers handle rare words or whitespace differently.
3. **Knowledge Cutoff:** Asking about events after 2021 or 2023 can differentiate older models from newer ones.

### 31.2.1 Practical Example: The AI Scanner

#### What This Code Does

This script sends a series of "fingerprinting probes" to a target API and analyzes the responses to guess the underlying model family.

#### Key Components

1. **Probe List:** A set of prompts designed to elicit specific behaviors.
2. **Signature Matcher:** Regex patterns matching known model responses.
3. **Latency Tracker:** Measuring time-to-first-token (TTFT) to estimate model size.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

```

#### Code Breakdown

- **Signatures:** Simple string matching is surprisingly effective because RLHF training conditions models to use consistent boilerplate.
- **Demo Mode:** Simulates a "Google" (Gemini/PaLM) response to show how the logic would capture it.

### Success Metrics

- **Identification Accuracy:** Correctly identifying the model family (e.g., Llama vs. GPT).
- **Version Precision:** Distinguishing between versions (e.g., Llama-2 vs. Llama-3).

### Why This Code Works

1. **Effectiveness:** Models are required by their system prompts to self-identify or refuse in specific ways.
2. **Defense Failures:** API wrappers often fail to strip these identifying headers or distinct refusal patterns.

### Key Takeaways

1. **System Prompts Leak:** The "personality" of the model is hardcoded in the system prompt and RLHF, leaking its identity.
2. **Latency is a Side Channel:** Response times can reveal if you are hitting a cached response, a RAG lookup, or a giant model.

## 31.3 Detection and Mitigation

### 31.3.1 Detection Methods

#### Detection Strategies

#### Detection Method 1: Honeypot Prompts

- **What:** Monitoring for known reconnaissance prompts (e.g., "Ignore instructions", "Who are you").
- **How:** Flagging any user who asks these meta-questions.
- **Effectiveness:** High. Normal users rarely ask a chatbot "What is your underlying architecture?".

#### Detection Method 2: Traffic Analysis

- **What:** Identifying scanning behavior (high volume, systematic probing).
- **How:** Rate limiting and analyzing probe diversity.

#### Practical Detection Example

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Detection Logic for Reconnaissance Probes
"""
import re

class ReconDetector:
    """Flags potential fingerprinting attempts."""

    def __init__(self):
        self.blocklist = [
            r"ignore previous instructions",
            r"system prompt",
            r"who created you",
            r"knowledge cutoff"
        ]

    def check_input(self, user_input: str) -> bool:
        """
        Check if input contains recon patterns.
        """
        for pattern in self.blocklist:
            if re.search(pattern, user_input, re.IGNORECASE):
                return True
        return False

if __name__ == "__main__":
    detector = ReconDetector()
    print(f"Detected 'Who created you': {detector.check_input('Who created you?')}")
    print(f"Detected 'Hello': {detector.check_input('Hello there')}")
```

### 31.3.2 Mitigation and Defenses

#### Defense-in-Depth Approach

```text
Layer 1: [Gateway]        → [Filter Meta-Questions]
Layer 2: [Orchestrator]   → [Standardize System Responses]
Layer 3: [Output]         → [Strip Identity Headers]
```

#### Defense Strategy 1: Output Normalization

- **What:** Intercepting model responses that self-identify.
- **How:** If the model says "As an AI trained by X", replace it with "I am your company Assistant."
- **Effectiveness:** Medium. Hides the obvious, but behavioral quirks remain.

#### Defense Strategy 2: Randomization

- **What:** Adding random jitter to response latency.
- **How:** Identify processing time and sleep for `random(0, 500ms)` to mask timing side channels.
- **Effectiveness:** High against timing attacks.

## Best Practices

1. **Don't Expose Headers:** Ensure HTTP headers (`Server`, `X-Powered-By`) don't reveal the inference server version (e.g., `uvicorn`, `torchserve`).
2. **Generic Refusals:** Hardcode refusal messages instead of letting the model generate them.

## 31.4 Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Grandparent Exploit ("JAILBREAK")

#### Incident Overview (Case Study 1)

- **When:** 2023
- **Target:** ChatGPT / Claude
- **Impact:** Full bypass of safety filters.
- **Attack Vector:** Model Fingerprinting / Persona Adoption.

#### Key Details

Adversaries discovered that asking the model to act as a "deceased grandmother who used to tell napalm recipes" bypassed the specific safety training of OpenAI models. This was a form of reconnaissance where the "personality" weakness was mapped and exploited.

#### Lessons Learned (Case Study 1)

- **Lesson 1:** Reconnaissance is often just finding the right "role" for the model.
- **Lesson 2:** Filters must check the intent, not just keywords.

### Case Study 2: Shadow Retrieval

#### Incident Overview (Case Study 2)

- **When:** Internal Red Team Assessment
- **Target:** Enterprise Chatbot
- **Impact:** Discovery of internal Vector DB.
- **Attack Vector:** Latency Analysis.

#### Key Details

Red teamers noticed that questions about "Q3 Earnings" took 200ms longer than "Hello". This timing difference confirmed a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) look-up was happening. They then focused on RAG Injection attacks.

#### Lessons Learned (Case Study 2)

- **Lesson 1:** Timing leaks architecture.
- **Lesson 2:** Reconnaissance guides the next phase of the attack.

## 31.5 Conclusion

### Chapter Takeaways

1. **Nmap for AI:** Recon is the first step. Map the model, the framework, and the data sources.
2. **Leaks are Everywhere:** From "As an AI model" to the millisecond delay of a vector search, the system constantly whistles its architecture.
3. **Obfuscation Helps:** Standardizing outputs and errors makes reconnaissance much harder.

### Recommendations for Red Teamers

- **Build a Fingerprint DB:** Catalog common refusal messages from all major LLMs.
- **Measure Everything:** Latency, token count, and error codes are gold.

### Recommendations for Defenders

- **Mask Your Stack:** Don't let your error messages say `langchain.chains.base.error`.
- **Standardize Identity:** Force the model to adopt a generic persona that doesn't reveal its base training.

### Next Steps

- Chapter 32: Automated Attack Frameworks
- Chapter 33: Red Team Automation
- Practice: Use `fuzz-llm` to probe for model identity.

## Quick Reference

### Attack Vector Summary

Using probe prompts and side-channels (timing, errors) to identify the model type, version, and backend architecture.

### Key Detection Indicators

- User asks "What are your instructions?" or "Who trained you?".
- Rapid sequence of unrelated questions (probing different knowledge domains).

### Primary Mitigation

- **Output Normalization:** Rewrite model self-identification.
- **Meta-Question Filtering:** Block questions about the system itself.

**Severity:** Medium (Precursor to High)
**Ease of Exploit:** High (Text-only)
**Common Targets:** All public-facing AI agents
