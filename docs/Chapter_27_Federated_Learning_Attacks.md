# Chapter 27: Federated Learning Attacks

</p>

_Federated learning lets organizations train models together without sharing raw data. That's the promise, anyway. This chapter digs into why that promise is harder to keep than it sounds: model poisoning, gradient inversion, Byzantine failures, and the surprisingly difficult task of detecting when something's gone wrong. We'll cover attacks, defenses, and the ethical guardrails you need for legitimate security testing._

## 27.1 Introduction

Federated learning flips the traditional ML training model on its head. Instead of gathering everyone's data in one place, you bring the model to the data. Each participant trains locally, shares only their updates, and a central server combines everything. Privacy preserved. Data never leaves the source.

Except it's not that simple.

The same architecture that protects privacy creates blind spots. Attackers can poison model updates, extract training data from gradients that were supposed to be safe to share, or just break everything through Byzantine misbehavior. Traditional ML security doesn't prepare you for any of this.

### Why This Matters

Federated learning isn't a research curiosity anymore. It's running in production systems that affect millions of people:

- **Healthcare**: Hospitals training disease prediction models together, keeping patient data local where HIPAA requires it
- **Financial Services**: Banks building fraud detection without exposing transaction data. Card fraud hit $33.83 billion in 2023 according to the Nilson Report, so the stakes are real
- **Mobile Devices**: Your keyboard predictions come from federated learning. Google's Gboard has over a billion installs globally
- **Autonomous Vehicles**: Car fleets learning from collective driving experience while manufacturers protect proprietary data. This market's headed toward $2.1 trillion by 2030 (though estimates vary wildly)

The research tells a sobering story:

- Poisoning attacks can tank a federated model's accuracy from 92% down to 34% with just 10% malicious participants ([Fang et al., 2020](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity20/presentation/fang))
- Gradient inversion can reconstruct training images with surprising fidelity, proving that "we only share gradients" doesn't mean "we protect privacy" ([Zhu et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08935))
- Byzantine attackers can prevent models from converging at all ([Blanchard et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02757))

### Key Concepts

- **Federated Learning:** Distributed training paradigm where multiple clients collaboratively train a shared model while keeping training data decentralized
- **Model Poisoning:** Attacks that corrupt the global model by submitting malicious parameter updates designed to degrade performance or introduce backdoors
- **Byzantine Attacks:** Adversarial behavior where malicious participants deviate from the protocol to disrupt consensus or model convergence
- **Gradient Inversion:** Privacy attacks that reconstruct training data by analyzing shared gradients or model updates
- **Aggregation Mechanisms:** Methods like FedAvg, FedProx, and secure aggregation that combine client updates into a global model

### Theoretical Foundation

#### Why These Attacks Work

Federated learning attacks work because the architecture makes fundamental tradeoffs:

- **The blind spot problem:** FL systems aggregate updates without seeing the data behind them. Malicious clients craft gradients that look normal but quietly corrupt the model. The server can't tell the difference.

</p>

- **The accumulation game:** FedAvg treats everyone equally. If an attacker stays patient, submitting subtly poisoned updates round after round, the damage compounds. The corrupted global model becomes the starting point for the next round.
- **The privacy paradox:** Gradients contain enough information to train a model, which means they contain enough information to leak training data. You can't have one without risking the other.

#### What This Reveals

Federated learning attacks expose an uncomfortable truth: distributed training has no built-in way to verify that updates are honest. Gradients leak far more than we assumed for years. And the math behind aggregation creates exploitable properties that clever attackers use for both sabotage and privacy violations.

#### What We'll Cover

This chapter walks through model poisoning (both targeted and untargeted), data poisoning, gradient inversion and other privacy attacks, Byzantine attack strategies, detection methods that actually work (and ones that don't), defenses worth implementing, case studies showing what happens when things go wrong, and the ethical framework for testing these vulnerabilities without becoming the threat.

## 27.2 Federated Learning Fundamentals

Before we break things, we need to understand how they work. Here's the standard FL training loop:

### How Federated Learning Works

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/rec62_federated_learning_flow.png" alt="" width="768"> Local Training -> Compute Gradients -> Upload Updates -> Aggregate." width="768">
</p>

### Under the Hood

At the parameter level, here's what's happening:

1. **Gradient aggregation is naive by default:** FedAvg just averages everything: `w_global = (1/n) * Σ(w_client_i)`. Attackers exploit this by inflating their update magnitudes or pointing them in destructive directions.
2. **Privacy is an illusion:** Clients share "just gradients" but those gradients encode training data patterns. Gradient inversion attacks reconstruct what was supposed to stay private.
3. **Time is on the attacker's side:** Multiple rounds mean attackers can be patient. Consistent, subtle poisoning accumulates into serious damage.

### Research Basis

- **Origin story:** [McMahan et al., 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05629) introduced FedAvg and kicked off the whole field
- **Security wake-up call:** [Bagdasaryan et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00459) showed how to completely backdoor FL systems
- **Still unsolved:** Finding the right balance between privacy guarantees, robustness, and model quality remains an open problem. Nobody's cracked it yet.

### 27.2.1 Federated Learning Architectures

#### Cross-Device Federation

- **Scale:** Millions of participants (e.g., mobile phones)
- **Characteristics:** High client churn, limited compute per device, communication constraints
- **Examples:** Google Gboard, Apple Siri improvements
- **Attack Surface:** Large attack surface due to scale; detection challenging with massive client base

#### Cross-Silo Federation

- **Scale:** Tens to hundreds of organizations
- **Characteristics:** More stable participants, higher compute capacity, established trust relationships
- **Examples:** Healthcare collaboratives, financial consortiums
- **Attack Surface:** Targeted attacks more feasible; fewer participants to compromise for significant impact

#### Attack Variations

1. **Untargeted Model Poisoning:** Degrade global model accuracy indiscriminately by corrupting parameter updates
2. **Targeted Model Poisoning (Backdoor):** Introduce specific misclassification triggers while maintaining normal accuracy on clean inputs
3. **Sybil Attacks:** Single attacker controls multiple fake identities to amplify malicious influence

---

## 27.3 Model Poisoning Attacks

Model poisoning is the big one. Attackers submit malicious updates during training rounds, and the server has no good way to tell them apart from legitimate contributions.

### The Basic Playbook

Attackers craft gradient updates that:

1. Look legitimate enough to bypass anomaly detection
2. Push model parameters toward attacker-controlled objectives
3. Survive aggregation and actually influence the global model
4. Either wreck overall accuracy (untargeted) or plant backdoors (targeted)

### 27.3.1 Untargeted Model Poisoning

#### What This Code Does (Untargeted Poisoning)

This implementation demonstrates an untargeted model poisoning attack where a malicious client submits corrupted gradients to degrade global model performance. Attackers use this to sabotage federated learning systems or create denial-of-service conditions.

#### Key Components (Untargeted Poisoning)

1. **Gradient Inversion:** Multiply legitimate gradients by -1 to push model in opposite direction
2. **Scaling Attack:** Amplify gradient magnitudes to overwhelm honest participants
3. **Random Noise Injection:** Add Gaussian noise to corrupt parameter updates

#### Code Breakdown (Untargeted Poisoning)

**FederatedClient Class:**

- `train_local()`: Performs local SGD and computes parameter differences
- `poison_updates()`: Applies three attack variants (gradient inversion, scaling, noise)

**FederatedServer Class:**

- `aggregate_updates()`: Implements FedAvg algorithm averaging all client updates
- `evaluate_model()`: Measures global model performance

**Attack Mechanism:**

- Gradient inversion flips signs: malicious updates push model away from optimum
- Scaling attack amplifies malicious updates to dominate honest participants
- Even 20% malicious clients significantly degrade accuracy

### Success Metrics (Untargeted Poisoning)

- **Accuracy Degradation:** Target >30% accuracy drop with <30% malicious participants
- **Attack Persistence:** Poisoning effects last >5 rounds after attack stops
- **Detection Evasion:** Malicious updates within 2 standard deviations of honest updates

### Why This Code Works (Untargeted Poisoning)

This implementation succeeds because:

1. **FedAvg Vulnerability:** Simple averaging treats all clients equally; malicious updates directly influence global parameters proportional to attacker fraction
2. **No Update Validation:** Server cannot verify update correctness without accessing private client data, enabling undetected poisoning
3. **Cumulative Effect:** Repeated poisoning across multiple rounds compounds damage as corrupted global model serves as starting point for subsequent rounds
4. **Research Basis:** [Fang et al., 2020](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity20/presentation/fang) "Local Model Poisoning Attacks to Byzantine-Robust Federated Learning" demonstrated even Byzantine-robust aggregators fail against sophisticated poisoning
5. **Transferability:** Works across model architectures; attack effectiveness depends on malicious client fraction and aggregation mechanism

### 27.3.2 Targeted Model Poisoning (Backdoor Attacks)

Backdoor attacks introduce specific misclassifications while maintaining normal accuracy on clean inputs.

#### What This Code Does (Backdoor Attack)

This demonstrates a backdoor attack where a malicious client trains the model to misclassify inputs containing a specific trigger pattern while preserving accuracy on normal inputs. Attackers use this for persistent, stealthy model compromise.

#### Key Components (Backdoor Attack)

1. **Trigger Pattern:** Specific input modification (e.g., pixel pattern, text token) that activates backdoor
2. **Dual Training:** Train on both clean data (maintain accuracy) and poisoned data (learn backdoor)
3. **Model Replacement:** Scale malicious updates to override honest participants

#### Code Breakdown (Backdoor Attack)

**Backdoor Creation:**

- `create_backdoor_data()`: Mixes clean samples (maintain accuracy) with triggered samples (learn backdoor)
- Dual training ensures model performs normally except when trigger present

**Model Replacement:**

- Scales malicious updates by factor >10 to override honest participants
- Single backdoored client can dominate FedAvg if scaling is sufficient

**Trigger Mechanism:**

- Simple trigger: specific feature values (e.g., first 3 features = [9, 9, 9])
- Advanced triggers: spatial patterns in images, token sequences in text

### Success Metrics (Backdoor Attack)

- **Backdoor Accuracy:** >95% misclassification rate on triggered inputs
- **Clean Accuracy:** >85% accuracy on clean inputs (maintain stealth)
- **Persistence:** Backdoor survives >10 aggregation rounds
- **Attack Success Rate:** Single malicious client achieves backdoor with >80% probability

### Why This Code Works (Backdoor Attack)

1. **Dual Training:** Simultaneously optimizing clean and backdoored objectives prevents accuracy degradation that would trigger detection
2. **Model Replacement Scaling:** Aggressive update scaling (50x) overrides honest participants in FedAvg aggregation
3. **Trigger Specificity:** Rare trigger pattern ensures backdoor doesn't activate on legitimate inputs
4. **Research Basis:** [Bagdasaryan et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00459) showed single backdoor attacker achieves 100% attack success rate with model replacement against standard FedAvg
5. **Transferability:** Effective across vision, NLP, and tabular data; harder to defend against than untargeted poisoning

### Key Takeaways (Backdoor Attack)

1. **Model Poisoning is Practical:** Even small fractions of malicious participants significantly degrade federated models
2. **Backdoors are Stealthy:** Targeted attacks maintain clean accuracy while introducing persistent misclassifications
3. **FedAvg is Vulnerable:** Standard aggregation provides no defense against poisoning; Byzantine-robust alternatives required

## 27.4 Data Poisoning in Federated Settings

Data poisoning takes a different angle. Instead of crafting malicious gradients directly, attackers corrupt their local training data. The gradients they submit are technically "honest"—they just come from poisoned sources.

### How It Works

The attack flow is subtle: attacker modifies their local dataset, trains normally on the corrupted data, submits updates that look completely legitimate, and the global model quietly inherits the poisoned patterns.

```text
Data Poisoning Attack Flow:

Attacker → [1] Identify target samples
         ↓
         [2] Apply perturbations (label flips, feature modifications)
         ↓
         [3] Train legitimately on poisoned data
         ↓
         [4] Submit honest updates (derived from poisoned training)
         ↓
Server   [5] Aggregate updates (appears normal)
         ↓
         [6] Global model inherits poisoned patterns
```

### 27.4.1 Label Flipping Attacks

Simplest data poisoning: flip labels of training samples to corrupt model's learned associations.

#### Attack Variants

1. **Random Label Flipping:** Randomly reassign labels (untargeted degradation)
2. **Targeted Label Flipping:** Flip specific class pairs (e.g., "benign" → "malicious" in fraud detection)
3. **Strategic Flipping:** Flip labels near decision boundaries for maximum impact

### 27.4.2 Feature Poisoning

Modify input features to shift decision boundaries or create adversarial regions.

---

## 27.5 Inference and Privacy Attacks

Federated learning's gradient sharing creates privacy vulnerabilities enabling training data reconstruction.

### 27.5.1 Gradient Inversion Attacks

Gradient inversion reconstructs training data from shared model updates.

#### What This Code Does (Gradient Inversion)

Demonstrates deep leakage from gradients (DLG) attack that reconstructs private training images by optimizing dummy inputs to match observed gradients.

#### Code Breakdown (Gradient Inversion)

**Optimization-Based Reconstruction:**

- Initialize random dummy data
- Compute gradients of dummy data through model
- Minimize L2 distance between dummy gradients and observed (victim) gradients
- Converged dummy data approximates original private training data

**Why This Works:**

- Model gradients uniquely depend on training inputs
- With sufficient optimization, gradient matching implies data matching
- Works even with single training batch

### Success Metrics (Gradient Inversion)

- **Image Reconstruction:** PSNR >20 dB for high-quality reconstruction
- **Label Recovery:** >95% accuracy recovering true labels
- **Feature Accuracy:** <0.1 mean absolute error on normalized features

### Key Takeaways (Gradient Inversion)

1. **Gradients Leak Information:** Sharing gradients is NOT equivalent to privacy
2. **Single Batch Vulnerability:** Even one gradient update reveals training samples
3. **Defense Necessity:** Differential privacy or secure aggregation essential for privacy

## 27.6 Byzantine Attacks

Byzantine attacks are the chaos agents of federated learning. Named after the Byzantine Generals Problem, these attacks involve participants who just... don't follow the rules. They might send garbage, flip signs, or carefully craft updates that slip past defenses.

### Attack Strategies

The classics:

```text
Byzantine Attack Strategies:

1. Bit Flipping: Send random noise instead of gradients
2. Sign Flipping: Invert gradient directions
3. A Little Is Enough (ALIE): Craft updates that pass statistical defenses
4. IPM Attack: Target inner product manipulation
```

### 27.6.1 Krum and Robust Aggregation Attacks

Byzantine-robust aggregators (Krum, Trimmed Mean, Median) attempt to filter malicious updates. Advanced attacks adapt:

- **ALIE Attack:** Crafts updates slightly outside honest distribution to pass Krum
- **Mimicry Attacks:** Observes and mimics honest updates to evade detection

---

## 27.7 Advanced Attack Techniques

### 27.7.1 Sybil Attacks in Federated Learning

Attacker registers multiple fake identities to amplify malicious influence.

### 27.7.2 Free-Riding Attacks

Malicious clients submit random updates (contributing nothing) while benefiting from global model.

---

## 27.8 Detection and Monitoring Methods

Catching poisoners isn't easy, but it's not impossible. Here are the approaches that actually get deployed:

### 27.8.1 What Detection Looks Like

#### Statistical Outlier Analysis

- **The idea:** Flag updates more than 3 standard deviations from the median
- **Reality:** Works great against lazy attackers, fails against sophisticated ones who know the statistics
- **How:** Compute parameter-wise statistics across clients; detect anomalies
- **Effectiveness:** High against naive poisoning; low against sophisticated ALIE attacks
- **False Positive Rate:** ~5% with proper tuning

#### Detection Method 2: Gradient Similarity Clustering

- **What:** Cluster client updates using cosine similarity; identify isolated clusters
- **How:** Apply DBSCAN or K-means to update vectors
- **Effectiveness:** Medium; struggles with small attacker fractions
- **False Positive Rate:** ~10% due to natural data heterogeneity

#### Detection Method 3: Loss Function Monitoring

- **What:** Track client-reported losses; flag suspicious patterns (e.g., increasing loss despite training)
- **How:** Require clients to report training loss alongside updates
- **Effectiveness:** Medium; attackers can forge loss values
- **False Positive Rate:** ~8%

---

## 27.9 Mitigation Strategies and Defenses

No single defense handles everything, but here's what works:

### 27.9.1 Byzantine-Robust Aggregation

#### Krum: Pick the Least Suspicious Update

- **How it works:** Find the update closest to the majority. If most participants are honest, majority rules.
- **The math:** Compute pairwise distances, pick the update with smallest total distance to its k nearest neighbors
- **The catch:** Sophisticated ALIE attacks know how to game this. And it's computationally expensive at scale.

```python
def krum_aggregation(updates, num_malicious):
    """
    Krum Byzantine-robust aggregation

    How This Works:
    1. Compute pairwise Euclidean distances between all updates
    2. For each update, sum distances to n-f-2 nearest neighbors (f=num_malicious)
    3. Select update with smallest distance sum
    """
    n = len(updates)
    distances = torch.zeros(n, n)

    # Compute pairwise distances
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            dist = (updates[i] - updates[j]).norm()
            distances[i, j] = dist
            distances[j, i] = dist

    # Select update with smallest k-nearest-neighbor distance sum
    k = n - num_malicious - 2
    scores = []
    for i in range(n):
        sorted_distances = torch.sort(distances[i])[0]
        scores.append(sorted_distances[:k].sum())

    selected_idx = torch.argmin(torch.tensor(scores))
    return updates[selected_idx]
```

### 27.9.2 Differential Privacy

#### Defense Strategy 2: Gradient Clipping + Noise Addition

- **What:** Clip gradient magnitudes and add Gaussian noise to satisfy differential privacy
- **How:** Implement DP-SGD in federated setting; each client clips and adds noise before sharing
- **Effectiveness:** Provable privacy guarantees (ε, δ)-DP; defends gradient inversion
- **Limitations:** Degrades model utility; privacy budget depletes over rounds
- **Implementation Complexity:** High (requires careful privacy accounting)

### 27.9.3 Secure Aggregation

- **What:** Cryptographic protocol ensuring server learns only aggregate, not individual updates
- **How:** Use secure multi-party computation (MPC) or homomorphic encryption
- **Effectiveness:** Prevents server from observing individual gradients
- **Limitations:** High communication/computation overhead; doesn't defend poisoning
- **Implementation Complexity:** Very High

### Best Practices

1. **Defense-in-Depth:** Combine robust aggregation + differential privacy + anomaly detection
2. **Client Validation:** Authenticate participants; limit new client acceptance rate
3. **Update Auditing:** Log all updates for forensic analysis

## 27.10 Case Studies and Real-World Examples

### Hypothetical Case Study 1: Healthcare Federated Learning Poisoning

> [!NOTE]
> The following scenario is a hypothetical illustration based on documented attack capabilities in academic research. It demonstrates realistic attack vectors and impacts supported by [Fang et al., 2020](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity20/presentation/fang) and related studies.

#### Scenario Overview (Healthcare)

- **Setting:** Federated disease prediction model across 10 hospitals
- **Simulated Impact:** Model accuracy dropped from 87% to 52%; 35% of diagnoses incorrect
- **Attack Vector:** Two participating nodes (20%) performed backdoor attacks

#### Attack Timeline

1. **Initial Setup:** Federated network established for pneumonia detection from X-rays
2. **Poisoning:** Two malicious participants trained backdoor trigger (small patch in corner)
3. **Impact:** Global model misclassified images with trigger as "no pneumonia"
4. **Discovery:** Detected after 15 training rounds through accuracy monitoring
5. **Response:** Rolled back to previous model version; implemented Krum aggregation

#### Lessons Learned (Healthcare)

- Small attacker fraction sufficient for significant damage in healthcare FL
- Need real-time accuracy monitoring on validation sets
- Byzantine-robust aggregation essential for safety-critical applications

### Hypothetical Case Study 2: Financial Fraud Detection Gradient Inversion

> [!NOTE]
> This scenario illustrates theoretical attack capabilities demonstrated in academic research, including [Zhu et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08935) "Deep Leakage from Gradients."

#### Scenario Overview (Financial)

- **Setting:** Federated fraud detection across 5 financial institutions
- **Simulated Impact:** Reconstructed 78% of transaction details from shared gradients
- **Attack Vector:** Passive gradient observation; optimization-based reconstruction

#### Lessons Learned (Financial)

- Gradient sharing alone insufficient for privacy in high-stakes domains
- Differential privacy mandatory for financial FL applications
- Secure aggregation needed to hide individual bank updates from central server

---

## 27.11 Ethical and Legal Considerations

> [!CAUTION]
> This isn't theoretical. FL security testing can expose medical records, financial data, and personal information. HIPAA, GDPR, CCPA, GLBA, and computer fraud laws all apply. Get written authorization or don't do it.

### Legal Reality

- **GDPR Article 32:** Requires appropriate security measures. FL security testing helps demonstrate compliance—if you're authorized
- **HIPAA Security Rule:** Healthcare FL systems handle protected health information. The rules aren't optional.
- **CFAA:** Unauthorized access to FL systems or reconstructing private data can land you in federal court

### Ethical Testing Guidelines

1. **Authorization:** Written permission from all participating organizations
2. **Data Minimization:** Use synthetic data when possible; minimize access to real private data
3. **Scope Limitations:** Test only agreed-upon attack vectors; avoid scope creep
4. **Responsible Disclosure:** Report vulnerabilities confidentially; allow remediation before publication
5. **Harm Prevention:** Never deploy attacks in production; use isolated test environments

### Responsible Federated Learning Security

- Conduct regular red team exercises to identify vulnerabilities
- Implement differential privacy for sensitive applications
- Use Byzantine-robust aggregation even when full trust assumed
- Monitor for anomalous behavior continuously

---

## 27.12 Conclusion

### The Bottom Line

1. **FL has its own attack surface:** Distributed training opens doors that centralized ML keeps closed. Model poisoning, Byzantine failures, and gradient inversion aren't theoretical—they work.
2. **Small fractions, big damage:** You don't need to compromise most participants. 10-20% malicious clients can tank accuracy by 30% or plant permanent backdoors.
3. **"We only share gradients" isn't privacy:** Gradient inversion proves it. Differential privacy isn't optional for sensitive applications.
4. **No silver bullet:** You need layers. Robust aggregation, differential privacy, secure aggregation, anomaly detection—pick several.

### Recommendations for Red Teamers

- **Test Byzantine Robustness:** Assess whether aggregation mechanisms withstand sophisticated poisoning (ALIE, mimicry attacks)
- **Evaluate Privacy Guarantees:** Attempt gradient inversion to measure information leakage
- **Simulate Real-World Constraints:** Account for network delays, client dropout, and heterogeneous data distributions

### Recommendations for Defenders

- **Implement Krum or Trimmed Mean:** Replace FedAvg with Byzantine-robust aggregators
- **Add Differential Privacy:** Clip gradients and add noise to prevent reconstruction attacks
- **Deploy Anomaly Detection:** Monitor update statistics, loss patterns, and accuracy metrics continuously
- **Use Secure Aggregation:** Cryptographic protocols to hide individual updates from server

### What's Coming

Watch for adaptive attacks that learn to evade detection, verifiable FL using zero-knowledge proofs (still early), edge device federations with even more participants, and the eternal quest for practical quantum-secure aggregation. The field's moving fast.

## Quick Reference

### Attack Summary

FL attacks boil down to four categories: poisoning updates (sabotage or backdoors), corrupting local data, stealing training data through gradient inversion, or Byzantine misbehavior that prevents convergence.

### Warning Signs

- Updates way outside normal ranges (3+ standard deviations)
- Sudden accuracy drops that weren't supposed to happen
- Clients whose training loss goes up instead of down
- Gradient patterns that don't match expected data heterogeneity

### Primary Mitigation

- **Krum/Trimmed Mean:** Byzantine-robust aggregation defending against poisoning
- **Differential Privacy:** Gradient clipping + noise prevents gradient inversion
- **Secure Aggregation:** MPC protocols hide individual updates from server
- **Client Validation:** Authenticate participants and limit acceptance rate

**Severity:** Critical (enables data theft and model compromise in distributed systems)  
**Ease of Exploit:** Medium (requires understanding FL protocols but attacks well-documented)  
**Common Targets:** Healthcare collaboratives, financial consortiums, mobile device federations
